# PlaceBook
This is the frontend for a full-stack MERN application that I created, which allows users to upload and share photos and information about places that they have visited. You can access the full project at: https://placebook-305917.web.app/

### What I Learned:
- Lazy loading routes for increased performance.
- Creating custom React hooks for cleaner, more modular code.
- Utilizing the useRef and useCallback hooks.
